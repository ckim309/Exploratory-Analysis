# About the Project
With cable TV slowly declining, streaming services are becoming more popular. Netflix is a widely used streaming service for movies and TV shows that earns a majority of their revenue through their subscription plans. 

This analysis looks at the revenue trend and the subscription trend for Netflix from the years 2018 to 2019 to determine the region with the highest marketing potential to increase revenue.

# Insight Summary

The Asia-Pacific has the highest marketing potential. Since Netflix is a streaming service that earns most of its revenue through subscriptions, there should be an effort to expand its customer pool. The Asia-Pacific is the leading region in bringing in and retaining customers as shown through the retention rate and subscription growth, leading to the most revenue growth from 2018 to 2019.

Therefore, data around demographics, genre of movies and TV shows, other streaming services, and promotion methods are necessary to plan the next marketing campaign to increase the subscription pool, resulting in more revenue for Netflix.
